# Team Contract

Within your group, agree on a group contract that will govern your collaboration. The contract should spell out the behaviors you expect of all group members, as well as procedures for resolving impasses in the group.

Specific questions to think about include the following:

* What is our level of ambition for this project?
* How will we communicate with each other?
* How often and where will we meet?
* How will we make sure that our meetings are productive?
* What behaviors do we expect from team members to ensure that the team is productive and reaches its goals and that every member can contribute to their fullest potential?
* What will we do if some team member violates any agreements in this contract?

Each team member should signal their agreement with this contract by adding their name at the bottom.


* Level of ambition: A little ambitious - one or two optional things to work on if we have the time
* Communication method: GroupMe
* Meetings: Once a week, ISEC, Fridays at 7-8 PM
* Make sure meetings are productive: Have a note-taker that switches every week, have an agenda, status updates
* Behaviors: Make progress on weekends so we can discuss if we run into issues, stay up to date with groupchat (24 hour grace period, except for day before due dates), try to have independent components, try to be on time and let people know if you have to be late, be prepared to give status update
* Violation Policy: Talk about it during meetings

We did a good job communicating and collaborating! There wasn't much of a chance to do a lot though, so issues may come up later. But for now, there are none! We don't think there's anything we need to change between now and our next retrospective, so we'll see what happens.

Pretty good job, but we need to communicate better about what everyone is doing, especially regarding what needs to be submitted. We should say in writing who is doing what.

10/22/25

What went well?
Everyone attended the meeting and maintained lines of communication via the Groupme.

What didn't go well?
We could have communicated better on who would handle what part of the hierarchy diagram assignment.
Could have divided up work better on the user testing, as there may have been more efficient ways to divide the work than what we did. 

What have I learned?
We need to more clearly and more efficiently divide up our work. 

What still puzzles me?
Nothing at the moment. 

What do we commit to:
Scrum meeting after class on Monday

What will we continue doing: 
Deliver on the work
Communicate any problems or updates to each other

10/29/25

What went well? 
Communication was good, collaboration was good. Some team members used git to help each other out with code which is good. All deadlines were met. Team members communicated when they needed help. 

What didn’t go well? 
We should communicate any major changes we make.
We should also articulate certain coding standards (include comments and javadocs)

What have I learned?
Get your work done early, so that others can review and help with any problems. 

What still puzzles me?
Nothing this week!

What do we commit to in the next sprint?
Keep our components separate, try and avoid conflicts. 

11/05/2025

What went well?
Communicated about our issues pretty well. Everyone was quick to respond on the GroupMe to any problems and pretty quickly helped each other out with any problems we ran into. 

What didn’t go well? 
Maybe we could collaborate on coding more, especially maybe when it comes to real-time problem solving together.

We should write better documentation so we can understand each others code. 

What have I learned? 
Working with others requires in-the-moment problem solving at times, which may be better handled in person. 

What still puzzles me?
The backend API can be confusing.

What are we focusing on this week? 
We're gonna focus on collaborating in person instead of GroupMe. We will also aim to distribute the work in a way that gives everyone a good amount of work, as well as the opportunity to collaborate.
