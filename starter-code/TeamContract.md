# Team Contract

Within your group, agree on a group contract that will govern your collaboration. The contract should spell out the behaviors you expect of all group members, as well as procedures for resolving impasses in the group.

Specific questions to think about include the following:

* What is our level of ambition for this project?
* How will we communicate with each other?
* How often and where will we meet?
* How will we make sure that our meetings are productive?
* What behaviors do we expect from team members to ensure that the team is productive and reaches its goals and that every member can contribute to their fullest potential?
* What will we do if some team member violates any agreements in this contract?

Each team member should signal their agreement with this contract by adding their name at the bottom.


* Level of ambition: A little ambitious - one or two optional things to work on if we have the time
* Communication method: GroupMe
* Meetings: Once a week, ISEC, Fridays at 7-8 PM
* Make sure meetings are productive: Have a note-taker that switches every week, have an agenda, status updates
* Behaviors: Make progress on weekends so we can discuss if we run into issues, stay up to date with groupchat (24 hour grace period, except for day before due dates), try to have independent components, try to be on time and let people know if you have to be late, be prepared to give status update
* Violation Policy: Talk about it during meetings

We did a good job communicating and collaborating! There wasn't much of a chance to do a lot though, so issues may come up later. But for now, there are none! We don't think there's anything we need to change between now and our next retrospective, so we'll see what happens.

Pretty good job, but we need to communicate better about what everyone is doing, especially regarding what needs to be submitted. We should say in writing who is doing what.
